Mark Humphries is a computational neurologist. 

The book is about the neurological code that our brain employs to achieve what it does, as the title says.

The book is densely packed with information, and I acquired a lot of new facts and concepts about the brain.
I strongly advise everyone interested in neuroscience to read this book.
